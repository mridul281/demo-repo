        After teaching myself for a year I started coding full-time when I joined the global it solution in February 2023. Two weeks into the course we learned how to skill developed SQA. Thanks to the collective power of the VS Code Live Share extension we were still able to pair prog programs and go through the syllabus as planned. Still, one of the things we missed out on from not being in person was organically sharing the little tips and tricks that you would typically pick up from working next to each other.
